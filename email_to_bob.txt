Hi [Recipient Name],
I'm [Your Name]
I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inform you that I will not be able to attend the scheduled 8 AM meeting today as I have come across some unexpected issues that require my immediate attention.
I apologize for any inconvenience caused and will do my best to make up for the missed meeting. If there's any information that I should prepare in advance for the meeting, kindly let me know, and I'll be happy to share it with the team.
Thank you for your understanding. I am looking forward to our next opportunity to collaborate.
Best regards, [Your Name]
